# Inflamed Breath

## Game Jam Entry

This is the repository for Inflamed Breath, a game that was created for [Mini Jam 160: Light](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-160-light). [Mini Jam](https://minijamofficial.com/) is a game jame for independent game developers hosted every other week. It lasts 72 with new themes and limitiations each time.

Mini Jam 160:

- Theme: Light
- Limitation: Speed is Key

The jam started at 12 AM EDT 6/7 and ended on 6/10 at 12 AM EDT. I started work at ~12 PM EDT 6/7.
